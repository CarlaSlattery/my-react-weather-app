# Five Day Forecast App

## Description

This application was produced as part of my syllabus with [CommandShift](https://commandshift.co.uk), as a way of learning to use [React](https://reactls.org). The project enables the user to enter in the location of any UK town or city and see a five day weather forecast of the location. A more detailed overview that includes minimum and maximum tempearture, humidity and wind information will also be displayed when the user selects further information on each corresponding day. 

Currently, the app is connected to the following to a [custom API](https://cmd-shift-weather-app-alt.onrender.com/) made by CommandShift.

## Installation and set up

To download the project-

* Fork the repository
* Within your selected folder, type `git clone` and paste the forked repository into the command line
* Run `npm install` 

The project has utilized the [Airbnb style guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/) but the rules have been extended in the .eslintrc file to allow both .js and .jsx extensions and prop spreading.

## Testing

[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) has been used for the tests and added to the env within .eslintrc.json.

To run all tests use `npm test`

## Future Updates

Additional functionality to search for global cities is planned for future updates.
